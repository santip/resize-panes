# Resize Panes package

## NOTE!!! this package has been deprecated by Atom

*Thanks @dcalhoun for figuring this out, in David's words:*
> Atom has now [deprecated the resize-panes package](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v1.0.0/build/deprecated-packages.json#L1275-L1278). This means the package will not be returned when searching. Atom also blocks the package from activating even if you already have resize-panes installed.
> 
> The reason Atom did this is because [the abilities of this package have been folded into core](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5902). One ability still missing is the [keybindings for resizing panes](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7332), but there is a [open PR to add this](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7354).
